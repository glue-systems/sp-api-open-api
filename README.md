## Requirements

PHP 7.2 and later.


## Authorization

## SP-API Clients

The code for each SP-API PHP client is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project and organized into namespaces by the developers of Glue Systems, LLC.

### Listings Items API

The ListingsItems API client was generated via the following script using the OpenAPI CLI Java tool, the version of which is `5.2.0-SNAPSHOT`.

```BASH
openapi-generator-cli generate -i path/to/listingsItems_2020-09-01.json -g php -o path/to/output --additional-properties=invokerPackage="Glue\SPAPI\OpenAPI\ListingsItems"
```

In the generated output, the contents of the `lib` folder were then transferred into this repository's [src/ListingsItems](src/ListingsItems) directory.

openapi-generator-cli generate -i path/to/supplySources_2020-07-01.json -g php -o path/to/output --additional-properties=invokerPackage="Glue\SPAPI\OpenAPI\SupplySources"
```

In the generated output, the contents of the `lib` folder were then transferred into this repository's [src/SupplySources](src/SupplySources) directory.

### Definitions Product Types API
