## Requirements

## SP-API Clients

The code for each SP-API PHP client is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project and organized into namespaces by the developers of Glue Systems, LLC.

### Listings Items API

The ListingsItems API client was generated via the following script using the OpenAPI CLI Java tool, the version of which is `5.2.0-SNAPSHOT`.

```

In the generated output, the contents of the `lib` folder were then transferred into this repository's [src/ListingsItems](src/ListingsItems) directory.
